## Our idea:
### The problem:
*Why*-> We noticed that Github is not a social environment, and also Gitter messages is not always sutible to use, on the other hand the social networks (like Facebook, twitter) is better for connection and making relationships, but also we can't explore others protoflio for example.

*What*-->**So** we built a community **(A BIG FAMILY)** that contains current and past members of FAC, with personal info and professional skills.

## Our users: :two_men_holding_hands: :two_women_holding_hands:
### Who?
Current and past FAC students, and the staff.
### Thier needs?
Make relations, Work, Discuss, Cross culture.
### Hypothesis:
* The importance of being a community, a family and a big **international** network.
*  FAC members needs a differant way to connect by a social media for example, with other campus.
